# Password Strength Checker

A full-stack web app to evaluate password strength and detect breaches in real time.

## How It Works
- Enter any password
- Check its length, entropy, character variety
- See estimated time to crack it (brute-force)
- Check if it has been exposed in a real-world breach using Have I Been Pwned
- View hashed versions (SHA-256, bcrypt, argon2)
